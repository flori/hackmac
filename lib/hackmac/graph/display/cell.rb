class Hackmac::Graph::Display
  # A cell representation for terminal display with character, color,
  # background color, and styling attributes
  #
  # The Cell class encapsulates the properties of a single character cell in
  # a terminal display, including its visual characteristics such as the
  # displayed character, text color, background color, and styling
  # attributes. It provides methods to compare cells and convert them to
  # their string representation with ANSI escape codes for terminal
  # rendering.

    # The == method compares two Cell objects for equality by their internal
    # array representation

    # Cell instance by comparing their underlying array representations
    # returned by to_a
    #
    # @param other [ Hackmac::Graph::Display::Cell ] the other Cell object to
    #   compare against

    # character along with its color, background color, and text style
    # attributes using ANSI escape sequences. The resulting string is
    # suitable for display in terminal environments that support ANSI colors.
